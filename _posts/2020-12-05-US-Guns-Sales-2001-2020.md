## Topic Selection and the Research Questions
Before the 2020 US election I came across an article on the internet<sup>1</sup> on the internet that caught my eye. I started to investigate into whether the 2020 election has anything to do with gun sales in US or if this year was any special. Or is it anything to do with the sitting president. This got me started in collecting the data and analyzing it. 

<sup>1</sup>[Washington Post News Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/29/walmart-guns-civil-unres/)


## Source Dataset

The data for this research is taken from National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)<sup>2</sup> database maintained by FBI. NICS system was launched in 1998 and the system allows Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) (authorized seller in US) to use the system to run a background check on the person. Since it's inception NICS has provided approximately 300 million checks and led to 1.5 million denials. NICS reports the data for each state on a monthly basis in a pdf format. Buzzfeednews.com maintain a csv format of the data from FBI in a csv format which was of great help in the data analysis.<sup>3</sup>

In addition to the NICS database the US population information of each state was also imported to normalize the gun sales data using population. For US population census.gov was used. Census dataset<sup>4</sup> only provided the population data from 2010-2019 while the population for 2020 was projected using 2019 data and 2018-2019 growth. The data from 2010-2013 population was dropped with this data set as another<sup>5</sup> dataset was used to fill the gap between 2000-2013.

## Visualization and Data Interpretation

For data analysis only the data from 2001-2020 is taken into account. The line plot shown below displays the gun sales month on month across US from 2001-2020. Major spike in gun sales are explained with the key events. This line plot also helps conclude that around each election then be it 2008, 2012, 2016 or 2020 there is an increase in gun sales. 
Generally, US buys guns mainly in the month of December each year. The trend of this sales can be seen consistently in the years for which the data is considered.

### Treemap for Population Change in US from 2001-2020

A valid argument could be made that states that has more gun sales may have more population. To normalize the gun sales data the population from 2001-2020 is shown in the treemap below that shows where the population in states has been concentrated over the years.

{% include Treemap_US_Population.html %}

### Total Annual Gun Sales and Population of US States by Year

The choropleth map below shows how the gun sales has fared by state each year along with the population data set. The color intensity shows the state that has the maximum gun sales in any time frame.

{% include Choropleth_Annual_Gun_Sales_Population.html %}
### Bar Plot showing Y-o-Y US Gun Sales

Clearly 2016 and 2020, both election years, made records and there is a significant spike in gun sales in both the years. 2020 is on the track to be a record year in gun sales with more than 30 million guns sold.

{% include Barplot_YoY_Gun_Sales_Population.html %}

### Bar Plot of different US states from 2001 to 2020

The bar plot below shows how gun sales pattern has shifted over time. In 2001, California accounted for the most gun sales while for 2020 Illinois has taken the spot.

### Bar chart race for Gun Sales from 2001 to 2020 of top 10 US States

The bar chart race shows the how the gun sales intensity shifted from California to Illinois in the past two decades. Surprisingly California has seen a consistent decline in gun sales between 2017-2019 with a little increase in 2020.

### Total Annual Gun Sales per 100k Population of US States by Year

The choropleth map below shows the number of guns per 100k population of any state in any given year. In 2001, Colorado, Montana and West Virginia accounted for most guns sold in US with 82, 78 and 76 guns per 100k individuals respectively. Fast forward twenty years, Kentucky, Illinois and Utah have taken the top spots. Without the population considered Illinois seemed to be a state that is buying a lot of guns however the statistics changes completely with the population considered. Kentucky has approx. 651 guns for every 100,000 individuals. Illinois close at 520 guns for every 100,000 individuals. Overall there has been a dramatic shift in the guns sales over the years clearly.

### Bar plot showing Y-o-Y US Gun Sales with population consideration

The bar plot shows the information in a bar plot setting to give a scale of change in the past twenty years. 

{% include Barplot_Annual_Gun_Sales_100k.html %}

### Bar chart race for Annual Gun Sales per 100k population from 2001 to 2020  of top 10 US States 

Kentucky emerged to the state buying the most guns first in 2006. That year the number of guns purchased per 100k individuals were almost four times compared to an year ago. 2007 was even worse than 2006 with almost double the number of guns bought an year ago. Kentucky has held the first spot since 2006 for the heighest number of guns sold per 100k individuals.

## Correlation and Regression Fitting

The states that bought the most guns per 100k individuals in 2020 were taken in account for this excercise. The states selected are Kentucky, Illinois and Utah. 

### Kentucky State Correlation and Regression Fitting

The correlation between Kentucky state's guns sold per 100k and it's population is approx. 91%. With linear regression it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Kentucky can be explained approx. 83% by population only.

### Illinois State Correlation and Regression Fitting

The correlation between Illinois state's guns sold per 100k and it's population is approx. 91%. With linear regression it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Illinois can be explained approx. 83% by population only.

### Utah State Correlation and Regression Fitting

The correlation between Utah state's guns sold per 100k and it's population is approx. 91%. With linear regression it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Utah can be explained approx. 83% by population only.
