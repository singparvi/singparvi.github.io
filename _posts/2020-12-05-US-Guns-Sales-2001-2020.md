## Topic Selection and the Research Questions
Before the 2020 US election I came across an article on the internet<sup>1</sup> on the internet that caught my eye. I started to investigate into whether the 2020 election has anything to do with gun sales in US or if this year was any special. Or is it anything to do with the sitting president. This got me started in collecting the data and analyzing it.
