## Topic Selection and the Research Questions
Before the 2020 US election I came across an article on the internet<sup>1</sup> on the internet that caught my eye. I started to investigate into whether the 2020 election has anything to do with gun sales in US or if this year was any special. Or is it anything to do with the sitting president. This got me started in collecting the data and analyzing it.

## Source Dataset

The data for this research is taken from National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)<sup>2</sup> database maintained by FBI. NICS system was launched in 1998 and the system allows Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) (authorized seller in US) to use the system to run a background check on the person. Since it's inception NICS has provided approximately 300 million checks and led to 1.5 million denials. NICS reports the data for each state on a monthly basis in a pdf format. Buzzfeednews.com maintain a csv format of the data from FBI in a csv format which was of great help in the data analysis.<sup>3</sup>

In addition to the NICS database the US population information of each state was also imported to normalize the gun sales data using population. For US population census.gov was used. Census dataset<sup>4</sup> only provided the population data from 2010-2019 while the population for 2020 was projected using 2019 data and 2018-2019 growth. The data from 2010-2013 population was dropped with this data set as another<sup>5</sup> dataset was used to fill the gap between 2000-2013.
