## Topic Selection and the Research Questions

Before the 2020 US election, a Washington Post News Article <sup>1</sup> caught my eye. I started to investigate whether the 2020 election has anything to do with gun sales in the US. Was this year due to COVID or perhaps the sitting president? This got me started in collecting data on US gun sales and analyzing it. 

## Source Dataset

The data for this research was obtained from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)<sup>2</sup> database maintained by the FBI. The NICS system was launched in 1998 and allowed a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), an authorized seller in the US, to run a background check on the buyer. Since its inception, NICS has provided approximately 300 million checks and led to 1.5 million denials. The denials may represent only 0.5%, but the data reveals which states are buying most guns in the US.  NICS reports the data for each state monthly in a pdf format. Buzzfeednews.com maintains a CSV format of the data from the FBI, which was of great help in the data analysis.<sup>3</sup>

In addition to the NICS database, the US population data of each state was also used. Information from census.gov <sup>4</sup> and jakevdp from GitHub data <sup>5</sup> was used to determine state populations from 2001-2019. The state populations for 2020 was extrapolated from 2018 and 2019 numbers.

## Visualization and Data Interpretation

For data analysis, only the data from 2001-2020 was considered. The line plot shown below displays the gun sales month on month across the US from 2001-2020. Key events explain major spikes in gun sales. There is an increase in gun sales around each election, be it 2008, 2012, 2016 or 2020.
The US buys guns mainly in December consistently year after year.

## Non-Normalized Data
The following section's data is not normalized, and the intention is to show that some states might seem like buying a lot of guns, but the states of interest change when accounted for the population.

### Total Annual Gun Sales and Population of US States by Year

The map below shows how gun sales have fared in the US by state each year with population dataset. The color intensity shows the state that has the maximum gun sales in any time frame. 

{% include Choropleth_Annual_Gun_Sales_Population.html %}
### US Gun Sales from 2001 to 2020

2016 and 2020, both election years, had record sales and there is a significant spike in gun sales in both years. 2020 is on track to be a record year in gun sales with more than 30 million guns sold as of November 2020.

### Total Gun Sales per US state from 2001 to 2020

To more concisely see the scale of change, here is the data formatted like a bar plot. The bar plot below shows how gun sale patterns shift over time. In 2001, California accounted for the most gun sales while for 2020, Illinois has taken the spot.

### Bar chart race for Gun Sales from 2001 to 2020 of top 10 US States

The bar chart race shows how gun sales intensity shifted from California to Illinois in the past two decades. Surprisingly California has seen a steady decline in gun sales between 2017-2019 with a little increase in 2020.

##**Normalized data**

The statistics presented in this section accounts for the population of various US states.

### Total Annual Gun Sales per 100k Population of US States by Year

The map below shows the number of guns sold per 100k population of any state in any given year. In 2001, Colorado, Montana and West Virginia accounted for most guns sold in the US with 82, 78 and 76 guns per 100k individuals respectively. Fast forward twenty years, Kentucky, Illinois and Utah have taken these spots. Kentucky has approximately 651 guns for every 100,000 individuals while Illinois at 520 guns for every 100,000 individuals. Overall there has been a dramatic shift in gun sales over the years. 

For 2020, Illinois seemed to be a state buying a lot of guns based on the total guns sold (see 2020 year in Bar chart race for Gun Sales from 2001 to 2020 of top 10 US States); however, the statistics changes with the population considered.

### Bar plot showing Y-o-Y US Gun Sales with population consideration

To more concisely see the scale of change, here is the data formatted like a bar plot. The bar plot shows the information in a bar plot setting to give a change scale in the past twenty years.  

{% include Barplot_Annual_Gun_Sales_100k.html %}

### Bar chart race for Annual Gun Sales per 100k population from 2001 to 2020  of top 10 US States 

Kentucky has held the first spot since 2006 for the highest number of guns sold per 100k individuals. That year the number of guns purchased per 100k individuals was almost four times greater in 2005. 2007 was yet another record than in 2006 with almost double the number of guns bought a year ago. Kentucky has held the first spot since 2006 for the highest number of guns sold per 100k individuals.

## Correlation and Linear Regression Fitting

The states that bought the most guns per 100k individuals in 2020 were Kentucky, Illinois and Utah, used for this post.  

### Kentucky State Correlation and Linear Regression Fitting

The correlation between Kentucky state's guns sold per 100k and its population is approximately 91%. With linear regression, it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Kentucky can be explained approximately 83% by population only.

### Illinois State Correlation and Linear Regression Fitting

The correlation between Illinois state's guns sold per 100k and its population is approximately 91%. With linear regression, it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Illinois can be explained approximately 83% by population only.

### Utah State Correlation and Linear Regression Fitting

The correlation between Utah state's guns sold per 100k and its population is approximately 91%. With linear regression, it can be interpreted that the gun sales per 100k in Utah can be explained approximately 83% by population only.
